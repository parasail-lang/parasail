--  These start states determine whether an apostrophe is interpreted
--  as a "tick" (aka "prime") or as a character literal.
--  This start state is associated with the back-tic (unquote)
--  which when encountered in a string literal, causes the next
--  token, or parenthesized expression, to be treated as being concatenated
--  (via the "|" operation) with the surrounding characters of the
--  string literal.
--  These "exclusive" start states relate to indentation
  -- The following is used to match all valid ParaSail identifiers
  -- except reserved words. Note that leading digits and underscores
  -- are not allowed and that double underscores are not allowed.
  -- The following are used to match all numeric literals.
  -- Note that double underscores are rejected.
