   This program is provided "as is" with no warranty.

The ParaSail parser was built using aflex and ayacc, which
were originally developed at the University of California, Irvine.
Aflex is in turn based on flex, which was originally developed
at the University of California, Berkeley.

The ParaSail reference manual (parasail_ref_manual.pdf) contains
the description of the full ParaSail language, as well as an appendix
with a short compiler/virtual-machine user manual.  Please READ THIS
APPENDIX!  It has important information on usage of the compiler,
and on the use of "vim -q" for handling compiler error messages.

The introductory article (parasail_intro.pdf) is probably worth reading first.
It was published online at embedded.com in a slightly different form:

   http://www.embedded.com/design/other/4375616/ParaSail--Less-is-more-with-multicore

The powerpoint presentation is one that was used at the June 2012 meeting
of the New England Programming Languages and Systems group.

Not all ParaSail features are currently implemented.  See the standard library
(aaa.psi) and the example programs for illustrations of features that 
are implemented.  The standard library (aaa.psi) contains quite a number 
of examples of ParaSail coding, so be sure to look it over.
See below for the list of unimplemented features.

The compiler does some error recovery, but after a couple of syntax
errors it sometimes gets totally confused.  That means you should 
not spend too much time diagnosing syntax errors unless they are some of the
first ones reported in a given run.  Use "vim -q" to fix the first
few syntax errors, and then try again.

The following ParaSail features are *not* yet implemented:

  * infinite precision implementations of Univ_Integer and Univ_Real
    (at the moment these are 64-bit signed integer and 64-bit IEEE Float,
     respectively, except that -2**63 is reserved as the null value for
     Univ_Integer, and all ones (NaN) is reserved as the null value for
     Univ_Real)
  * formal operation parameters of modules
  * "optional" applied to an operation
  * "global" mode for operation inputs
  * a "case" statement where the choices are named polymorphic types
  * multiple outputs from an operation (e.g. "func Foo() -> (X : Set; Y : Map)")
  * an aggregate as the LHS of an assignment (e.g. "(X, Y) := (Y, X);")
  * type conversions (e.g. "My_Int_Type(X)")
  * full compile-time checking of annotations, null-ness, and aliasing
    (simple assertions and some null-ness is checked at run-time currently)
  * value-constraint annotations on type and object declarations
       (e.g. "type Teens is Age { Teens in 13..19 };")
  * generalized properties (such as Operator#identity or Enum#last)

The following ParaSail features have recently been implemented:

  * [rev 1.3] hierarchical module names (e.g. Project::Utils::Hash_Map)

  * [rev 1.4] "forward" or "reverse" specified on individual iterators in a
              "for" loop with multiple iterators. E.g.:
              for (each Elem of My_Map; I in 1..1000 forward) loop ...
                // This iterates over My_Map in an unspecified order, 
                // but iterates over 1..1000 in the forward direction
  * [rev 1.4] Univ_Real plus fixed-point and floating-point types
              (using the Fixed and Float modules in aaa.psi).
  * [rev 1.4] Named and defaulted parameters to operations and modules
  * [rev 1.4] Use of named constants such as Time::Hour
  * [rev 1.4] "queued" keyword for operation inputs (see locked_box.psl)
  * [rev 1.4] Ordered_Set module (see aaa.psi)
  * [rev 1.4] Time and Clock modules with Delay (see aaa.psi)
  * [rev 1.4] definition of an operation by equivalence to operator in
              another module. E.g.:
              op "in"(Left : Fixed; Right : Ordered_Set<Fixed>) 
                -> Boolean is in Ordered_Set<Fixed>;
                // This says the "in" operator for "Fixed" is defined
                // in Ordered_Set.

  * [rev 1.5] Precomputation of named module-level constants 
              (rather than reevaluating them on each use).
  * [rev 1.5] Additional ParaSail Virtual Machine instructions specific to
              particular kinds of literals, including Real, Char, and Enum;
              generally more readable PSVM instruction display in ".lst" files.
  * [rev 1.5] Fully multi-threaded virtual machine (single-threaded versions
              still available for reduced resource usage -- see bin/*_st.exe).

  * [rev 1.6] Require 'queued' on operation as a whole that calls
              queued operations internally.  This is relevant for scheduling;
              also, a locked operation must not called such a queued operation,
              as it could result in an indefinite length of holding a lock.
  * [rev 1.6] Scheduling now takes account of threads which might perform
              queued calls internally, and avoids serving such a thread
              from a server that is waiting for other threads to complete, so
              as to avoid creating a deadlock situation.
  * [rev 1.6] When a type name is used where an object is expected, see
              whether the "[..]" operator is defined, and if so, call that
              to produce a set of all values of the type.
  * [rev 1.6] We no longer automatically look in Set<X> and Countable_Set<X>
              when we see A..B where A and B are of type X.  Instead, we
              rely on the type X to have definitions of "|", "..", etc.
              which are "forwarded" to the appropriate Set module using
              the "is in Set<X>" syntax for defining an operation.

  * [rev 1.7] Fix problem with resolution of "T::[..]".
  * [rev 1.7] Fix problem with annotations that involve nested parallelism.
  * [rev 1.7] Fix problem with module instantiations where one of the
              actual types is another complex module instantiation.

  * [rev 1.8] Support "generic" operations where a type of a parameter
              is specified as any suitable instance of a particular interface,
              such as a "generic" concatenation operator:
                 op "|"(X : Univ_String; Y : Y_Type is Imageable<>) 
                   -> Univ_String;
  * [rev 1.8] Support "generic" operations where the *value* of a parameter
              is treated as a "generic" parameter, such as in an
              exponentiation operator when units checking is performed:
                 op "**"(X : Units; <Y : Univ_Integer>)
                   -> Result_Type is Units<Dimension => Dimension * Y>;
              The dimension exponents for the result type is produced
              by multiplying the dimension exponents of the left operand
              times the value of the exponent Y.

  * [rev 1.9] Support more complex expressions of calls on generic operations.
              The units.psl example now illustrates units checking.
  * [rev 1.9] Use a simpler representation for "large" nulls, so no
              level of indirection is required.

  * [rev 2.0] Support polymorphic objects, declared, for example,
              of type Expr+.  Support declaration, assignment,
              and passing polymorphic objects as parameters, and
              use run-time dispatching when applying a "primitive" operation
              of a type to a polymorphic object.
  * [rev 2.0] Support inheritance through module extension.
              This includes inheriting components and operations from
              a specified parent type.  Support both fully-abstract
              modules, where all operations are implicitly abstract,
              and partially-abstract modules, where some but not all
              operations are declared explicitly abstract.

  * [rev 2.1] Support type inference even when calling "generic" operations
              such as matrix multiplication or matrix transpose.  That is,
              allow "const TV := T(V);" where the type of TV is inferred
              from the generic result type of the T (transpose) operation,
              with appropriate substitutions made.

  * [rev 2.2] Initial implementation of check for race conditions.  Does
              not currently handle container indexing/slicing completely.

  * [rev 2.3] Better support for hierarchies of nested modules and
              nested polymorphic types.

  * [rev 2.4] Support X?Y:Z and (if X then Y else Z)

  * [rev 2.5] Support labels in annotations for documentation purposes
              (e.g. "{*Stack_Overflow_Check*  S.Cur_Len < S.Max}").
              Support quantified expressions using "for all" or "for some"
              (e.g. (for all X of A => A.Max() >= X)).

  * [rev 2.6] Support container aggregate with nested iterator (e.g.
              "[for I in 1..10 => I**2]").  Also allow separate specification
              of "key" in such an aggregate, by adding ", key =>" (e.g. 
              "[for I in 1..10, Keys[I] => Values[I] ]").  Support nested
              annotations (e.g. "{{X == Y**2}}").  Intent
              is that nested annotations are not necessarily provable at
              compile time, and are focused on functional correctness rather
              than safety.  Might only be checkable by testing.

  * [rev 2.7] Allow implicit conversion *to* universal types as well as
              *from* universal types.  For example, if a container is
              indexed by Univ_Integer, then any type convertible to
              Univ_Integer (i.e., having a "to_univ" operator returning
              Univ_Integer) can be used as an index.  This allows writing
              simply "V[X]" rather than the more verbose "V[ [[X]] ]"
              to index into a vector V indexed by Univ_Integer.  If this
              implicit conversion is not desired, then the "indexing"
              operator should have a non-universal type as its index type.

  * [rev 3.0] Support exit from parallel constructs, such as a concurrent
              loop or a block using the "||" statement separator.

              The interpreter supports a "checks on" and a "checks off"
              command to turn run-time checking on (the default) or
              off.  These are recognized when the "Command to execute:"
              prompt is given.  Currently only assertions are checked.  
              Pre- and postconditions are not being checked yet.

  * [rev 3.0.1] Fix bug in parallel construct exit which occurs if there
              are multiple picothreads on the delay queue at the time of
              exit.

  * [rev 3.1] Fix issues with nested interfaces and with polymorphic
              objects where "wrapped" value was of a "small" type.
              Fix issues with inheriting operations that are only visible
              for the purpose of implementing certain other interfaces.

  * [rev 3.2] Improve detection of inappropriate calls on abstract operations.
              Detect when interface of operation uses polymorphic type
              for a parameter, while implementation uses non-polymorphic type, 
              or vice-versa.

              Support "continue" statement with named or multiple values, 
              such as "continue loop with X => X.Left;" and 
              "continue loop with (I => I+1, J => J-1);"

              Support defining an operation with a single expression,
              as in "func Square(X : Integer) -> Integer is (X**2);"

              Support case expressions, such as:
                (case C of [#red] => X; [#green] => Y; [#blue] => Z)

              Support instantiating a module with a polymorphic actual type,
              such as "var VP : Vector<Expr+>;"

  * [rev 3.3] Initialize optional outputs to null, even if "small."
              Properly initialize static link when calling nested
              operations.

              Add From_Vector/To_Vector operations for converting
              Univ_String from/to a Vector of univ characters.
              Add corresponding From_ZVector/To_ZVector for converting
              ZStrings from/to a ZVector of univ characters.

  * [rev 3.4] Implement declaring and passing operations as parameters
              of operations (operations as parameters of modules not 
              yet supported).  Support passing lambda expressions
              as parameters.

  * [rev 3.5] Define (if X then Y) to be equivalent to (if X then Y else null).
              Fix bug where certain annotations were ignored if they
              immediately preceded or followed a call on an operation.
              Improve statistics, including computing some averages.
              Support "stats [keep]" and "stats clear" commands.
              Add statistics about region allocations.
              Use "<|=" operator rather than "var_indexing" if available
              when constructing an aggregate such as "[for I in 1..10 => I*5]".
              Allow "reverse" (or "forward" which is the default) in aggregate
              such as "[for in in 1..10 reverse => I*5]".

  * [rev 3.5.1] Back out change preferring "<|=" over "var_indexing" 
              when building an aggregate such as "[for I in 1..10 => #true]",
              as this was breaking existing code using such an aggregate
              to create an object of type "Array<Boolean, Integer>."
              However, if "reverse" or "forward" is specified before "=>",
              then "<|=" will still be preferred over "var_indexing".
              Suppress interpreter statistics if any compile-time errors 
              are detected, as they are just noise then.

  * [rev 3.6] First source release.  Add "magnitude" operator (|...|)
              as a synonym for Length or Abs or Count or ..., as appropriate.
              Check indenting, give warnings if not using "standard" indenting.
              Begin implementation of "import" clause, and support for
              "significant" indenting a la Python (not completed yet).

              Support a kind of "map-reduce" construct:
                (for I in 1..10 => <0> + I**2)
              would produce a sum of squares.  The expression in <...>
              provides the initial result, and is replaced on each iteration
              with the prior result.  It will normally be the identity of
              the enclosing operation.  For example, this computes N factorial:
                (for I in 1..N => <1> * I)

  * [rev 3.7] Support filters given inside "{...}" in all for-loop constructs,
              including container comprehensions and our new map/reduce
              construct.  For example, this computes the sum of the
              first N odd integers:
                (for I in 1 ..< 2*N {I mod 2 == 1} => <0> + I)
              This produces a vector of the elements of a vector V that
              are less than its first element:
                [ for I in 1 <.. |V| { V[I] < V[1] } => V[I] ]
              which might be used as part of a QSort algorithm.

              Add support for a "Python"-like syntax, using ":" instead of
              "is"/"then"/"of"/"loop" and omitting the "end if"/"end loop"/etc.
              Semicolons are optional at the end of lines.  Indenting is 
              significant.  "end class"/"end interface"/"end func/op" are
              allowed, but optional.  Currently "end if," "end case," and
              "end loop" are not allowed if ":" is used.

              We have also introduced some Python-like synonyms:
              "def" is a synonym for "func"; "elif" is a synonym for "elsif";
              "# " may be used to introduce a comment instead of "//" (note
              the required space after the '#').  See examples/hippo_game.psl
              for an example.  This variant is tentatively dupped "PARython"
              and we may someday suggest the extension ".pry" rather than 
              ".psl" for sources using this syntax variant.

  * [rev 3.7.1] Turn off lexer debugging, inadvertently left on in rev 3.7

  * [rev 3.8] Support "import" clauses for restricting visibility to
              particular sets of stand-alone modules.  Always includes
              PSL::Core::* and PSL::Containers::*.  In absence of explicit
              "import" clauses, there is an additional default import of:
                 [<prefix_of_module_if_any>::]*
              which has the effect of making all "sibling" units visible.

              Support qualified literals, such as "Boolean::#true".

              Interactive commands may now include "::" in operation name,
              and quotes are no longer required around arguments that start
              with a letter.

              Added PSL::Core::IO, PSL::Core::File_Input_Stream, and
              PSL::Core::File_Output_Stream to standard library (aaa.psi).

              Min and Max now allow a null operand, and return the
              non-null operand.  Min and Max return null only if both operands
              are null.  This allows null to be used as the initial value
              when computing Max or Min over a possibly-empty sequence,
              with null being the final result if the sequence is in fact
              empty.  This works well for a map/reduce using Max or Min,
              allowing null to be used as the identity value.

  * [rev 3.9] More support for operations on polymorphic types, including
              binary operations, where it is an error if the two operands
              have different underlying types, unless the operator is "=?".
              "=?" is a special case, where rather than an error, it returns
              #unordered if two polymorphic operands have different 
              underlying types.  This now allows us to define a type
              like Set<Hashable+> and have it work as desired, that is,
              as a Set holding (almost) any type.

              We have a preference now for non-generic operations when
              there would otherwise be ambiguity between a normal operation
              and a generic operation of the same name.  This is relevant
              for the "|" operator on Univ_String.  We have now added
              To_String and From_String on Univ_String (these are identity
              operations), which means Univ_String now implements the
              "Imageable<>" interface.  The new preference rules prevents
              this from creating ambiguity on <univ-string> | <univ-string>.
 
              We know allow {> ... <} for annotations as a substitute
              for { ... }.  This will allow us to eventually use { ... }
              for Set/Map constructors in the PARython dialect.  The
              new {> ... <} syntax makes annotations a bit more obvious, which
              seems like a good thing.

              Even when still using "then"/"is"/"loop"/"of" instead of ":",
              we have made "end blah" optional.  Presumably project-specific
              rules might require "end blah" if the construct is too many
              lines long (e.g. more than 20 lines).
   
              Highlighting information for the ConTEXT source text editor
              is under share/tools/... in a file named ConTEXT_ParaSail.chl
              courtesy of ParaSail user Arie van Wingerden.  Similar
              information for the "geshi" highlighting system (used by
              WikiPedia) is in a file called geshi_parasail.php.

  * [rev 4.0] Case statements over polymorphic objects are now supported
              where the case choice has an associated identifier, such as in:

                var E : Expr+ := ...
                case E of
                  [L : Leaf] => ...
                  [U : Unary] => ...
                  [B : Binary] => ...
                  [..] =>
                end case;

              Note that the specified types for the case choices
              must be non-polymorphic types at the moment.  In a later
              release we will support having choices with polymorphic types,
              such as:
                [SE : Simple_Expr+] => ...
              where presumably Simple_Expr is an extension of Expr.

              We have added function types, of the form:
                   func(X : Integer; Y : Float) -> Integer"
              Basically the same syntax as a "func" declaration but without
              the func's identifier.  To declare a "func" that takes
              another "func" as a parameter, you would now use syntax like:
                 func Apply
                   (Op : func(X : Integer) -> Integer; S : Vector<Integer>)
                     -> Vector<Integer>
              rather than the former syntax:
                 func Apply
                   (func Op(X : Integer) -> Integer; S : Vector<Integer>)
                     -> Vector<Integer>

              The syntax for lambda expressions has been simplified, so
              you only specify the names of the inputs, with no mention
              of the types of the inputs or the outputs.  For example:
                  lambda (Y) -> 2*Y
              is a lambda expression that doubles its input.
              A lambda expr can be passed as a parameter so long as the type
              of the formal parameter is a compatible "func" type.  So for 
              example, given the above definition of "Apply", you could write:
                 Apply (lambda(Y)->2*Y, [1, 2, 3])
              and expect to get "[2, 4, 6]" as the result (presuming "Apply"
              does the natural thing).

  * [rev 4.1] When an expression does not resolve, provide additional
              diagnostics to help explain why.

  * [rev 4.2] Share lock between a polymorphic object and the non-polymorphic
              object it contains; share lock between object and its parent
              part, if any.  Handle "continue loop"s that exit blocks.
              Restructure to more easily handle new parser using same
              underlying language semantics, to support "Parython" and
              other language parallelization efforts.

  * [rev 4.3] When a "new" type is declared (type T is new Integer<...>) allow
              additional operations to be declared immediately thereafter
              in the same scope, and have them be visible wherever the type
              is later used, just as though a new module had been defined
              as an extension of the old module, and the new operations had
              been declared inside that new module.

              Improve diagnostics further for expressions that don't resolve.
  * [rev 4.4] Add prototype interface to GTK in gtk_cairo.psl, example
              in nqueens_gtk.psl.
  * [rev 4.6] Initial release of "Sparkel" compiler, parallel language
              inspired by SPARK subset of Ada.
  * [rev 4.9] Re-implementation of region-based storage management to minimize
              contention between processors.  This produced an approximate
              two times speed-up.
              Allow packages and instantiations inside of subprograms in
              Sparkel.
              Allow listing to be turned on and off with "-listing on/off"
              on the command line; default is off if "-command ..." given.
  * [rev 5.0] Initial release of "Javallel" and "Parython" compilers, parallel
              languages inspired by Java and Python.
  * [rev 5.1] Provide "Dest_Name" in PSVM "Store" and "Move" Instructions
              when used to initialize a local variable or constant, so as
              to help in debugging.
  * [rev 5.2] Re-implementation of work stealing to reduce contention
              between processors.  Each server now has a private double-ended
              queue (deque) of pico-threads, along with the shared triplet of 
              deques which has existed before.  This produced another two
              times speedup (in addition to the rev 4.9 improvements), thereby
              speeding up execution by four times or more since rev 4.8.
              The main procedures for each language (ParaSail, Sparkel, etc.)
              have been refactored to share more common code.
              Allow a command-line flag "-servers nnn" to specify the number
              of heavy-weight server threads to use.  Default is 6.
              Command can also be given interactively, as "servers nnn".
              Interactively it only works to increase the number; there is
              no way to shut down servers that already have been activated.

We are very interested in your feedback.  Please use the ParaSail Google 
Group (see link above) to provide whatever comments or suggestions you
